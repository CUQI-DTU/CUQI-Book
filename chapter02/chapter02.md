# Chapter 2: Prior and Hierarchical Bayesian Models

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Set up random variables following uni- and multivariate distributions in CUQIpy.
- Generate samples from distributions and use CUQIpy tools to inspect visually.
- Set up conditional distributions in CUQIpy - simple and using lambda functions.
- Create a user-defined distribution from a logpdf function.
- Explain the use of Geometry in distributions and samples.
- Describe the basic idea of Gibbs sampling.
- Define a hierarchical Bayesian model using CUQIpy.
- Define a Gibbs sampling scheme in CUQIpy.
- Run the Gibbs sampler and analyze the results.
