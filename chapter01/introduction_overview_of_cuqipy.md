## Introduction <a class="anchor" id="introduction"></a>

### What is CUQIpy? <a class="anchor" id="what-is-cuqipy"></a>
* CUQIpy is a Python package.
* CUQIpy stands for **C**omputational **U**ncertainty **Q**uantification for **I**nverse **P**roblems in **Py**thon.
* CUQIpy provides a framework for solving inverse problems using Bayesian inference.
* The framework enables:
  * Modeling Bayesian inverse problems
  * Solving Bayesian inverse problems using classical and advanced numerical tools
  * Analyzing the solution of Bayesian inverse problems

### CUQIpy modules <a class="anchor" id="cuqipy-modules"></a>
* CUQIpy consists of many modules for modeling, solving, and analyzing Bayesian inverse problems.
* These modules mostly correspond to typical steps/components in a Bayesian inverse problem.
* Each module contains classes and functions that are used to perform specific tasks.

### CUQIpy plugins <a class="anchor" id="cuqipy-plugins"></a>

* In addition to the CUQIpy modules, CUQIpy also has plugins that extend the functionality of the framework. 
* These plugins allows integration of third party software and tools with CUQIpy.
