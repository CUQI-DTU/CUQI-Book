# Chapter 2: Prior and Hierarchical Bayesian Models

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Create uni-variate and multivariate distributions in CUQIpy of different types, sample them and analyze the samples.
- Define Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) mathematically and compare i.i.d multivariate Gaussian distribution with `GMRF` in CUQIpy.
- Use the `Geometry` object to parametrize the unknowns represented by the the prior distribution.
- Create conditional distributions in CUQIpy, condition them and sample from them.
- Create a user-defined distribution from a logpdf function.
- Describe the basic idea of Gibbs sampling.
- Define a hierarchical Bayesian model using CUQIpy.
- Define a Gibbs sampling scheme in CUQIpy.
- Run the Gibbs sampler and analyze the results.
