# Chapter 4: Advanced Bayesian Inference in CUQIpy


- Today it will be open exploration with CUQIpy

- Resources:
  - https://github.com/CUQI-DTU/CUQIpy-demos (training/PDE and training/Plugins)
  - https://github.com/CUQI-DTU/Paper-CUQIpy-1-Core (paper I: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16949)
  - https://github.com/CUQI-DTU/Paper-CUQIpy-2-PDE (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16951)
  - https://github.com/CUQI-DTU/CUQIpy-User-Showcase

- Pick a notebook (or more?) and try it.
- Some of these have exercises (the ones in the demo folder https://github.com/CUQI-DTU/CUQIpy-demos)
- Explore the notebook, think of things to try/change/play with and try them.
- Ask questions if you have any.
- From 11:30 to 12:00 It will be great if everyone can share a bit (1 minute to 5 minutes) of what they have done, what they have learned, what they have found interesting, etc.
    - You can just tell us
    - You can also present something on the screen if you like.
