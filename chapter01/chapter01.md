# Chapter 1: Introduction to Bayesian Inverse Problems in CUQIpy

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Compare deterministic inversion with Bayesian-based inversion
- Compare typical Bayesian inference with Bayesian inversion
- List and explain methods of quantifying uncertainty in inverse problems
- Install CUQIpy
- Create, solve and analyze 2D Bayesian inverse problem (BIP) with CUQIpy
- Explain the difference between data distribution and likelihood
- Explain the role of prior and likelihood in the 2D example
